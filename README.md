                                          2. Medium
                                           3. Hard
                                          4. Random

When it prompts you for your move enter the x and y coordinates, and if you want to flag it, add something at the end.
Example: If x is 2 and y is 10, enter "0210"
Example: If x is 9 and y is 3 and you want to flag, enter "0903f" ("f" can be anything)
